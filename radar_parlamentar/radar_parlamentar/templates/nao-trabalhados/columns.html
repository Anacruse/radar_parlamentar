        In every folder in Windows, the Search box appears in the upper right corner. When you type in the Search box, Windows filters the view based on what you're typing. Windows looks for words in the file name, tags that you've applied to the file, or other file properties. To find a file in a folder, type any part of a file name in the Search box to find what you're looking for. You can also use Search folders when you don't know where a file is located or when you want to do an advanced search using more than just a single file name or property.
